# Python-OpenAIChat

Before running the terminal app, you need to set three system variables:

- "BASE_API" - API URL of chosen ai chat, for example https://api.deepseek.com or https://api.openai.com
- "CHAT_MODEL" - for example "deepseek-chat" or "gpt-4o-mini"
- "API_KEY" - your personal API key of the chat model

NOTES:

1. There's a mock service (OpenAiServiceMock) for testing. Have a look at the comments in main.py to learn how to use it
2. Before running the program, make sure you have installed all the necessary packages. You can do it by running the following command: pip install -r requirements.txt
