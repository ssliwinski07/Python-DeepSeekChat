# Python-OpenAIChat

Before running the terminal app, you need to set three system variables:

- "BASE_API" - API URL of chosen ai chat, for example https://api.deepseek.com or https://api.openai.com
- "CHAT_MODEL" - for example "deepseek-chat" or "gpt-4o-mini"
- "API_KEY" - your personal API key of the chat model

NOTES:

1. There's a mock service (OpenAiServiceMock) for testing. Have a look at the comments in main.py to learn how to use it
